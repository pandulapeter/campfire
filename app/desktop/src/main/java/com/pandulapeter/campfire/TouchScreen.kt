/**
 * Makes a finger on a touchscreen a touch to Compose rather than a mouse wheel, so that the lists, the pager and the
 * sheets are dragged and flung the way they are on a phone.
 *
 * The JetBrains Runtime takes a touchscreen's input on Windows and X11 itself and hands it on as mouse wheel events
 * of three scroll types of its own (`sun.awt.event.TouchEvent`): one where the finger comes down, one for every move
 * past a small radius, carrying how far it moved in the wheel rotation, and one where it lifts — followed, for a
 * finger that never left the radius, by a mouse click at that point. Compose Desktop reads the moves as wheel notches,
 * which on Windows are a twentieth of the scrolled area each and animated, so a finger that moves a hundred pixels
 * scrolls five screens, lifting it flings nothing, and nothing can be dragged at all. Every event of those scroll types
 * still carries where the finger is, which is all a touch pointer needs: an event queue of the window's own takes them
 * before Compose sees them and sends the window's scene a press, the moves and a release of a touch pointer instead,
 * dropping the click that follows a tap, which the press and the release already were.
 *
 * Compose Desktop has no public way to the scene a window renders, so it is found among the window's own objects by
 * its type (see [findComposeScene]). A Compose version that keeps it elsewhere leaves the events to Compose, which is
 * the behavior of a window without this.
 *
 * @return What stops translating the events.
