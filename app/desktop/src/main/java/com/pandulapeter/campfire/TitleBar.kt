 * window listens to the mouse, and Compose's canvas listens everywhere. (The macOS client properties that make a title
 * bar transparent lay the content out the same way, but the double click reaches the content there, and the window
 * never zooms.) So every mouse event over the strip is marked as the title bar's, which the runtime asks for per
 * event: an event listener of the toolkit runs after it has made its own guess and before it acts on it. Nothing of
 * the app is ever under the strip, which the screens keep clear of ([TitleBarInsets]), so there is nothing there to
 * take the mouse away from - except in full screen, where there is no strip and the app bar reaches the top edge. The
 * listener lives as long as the process does, like the one window it serves.
