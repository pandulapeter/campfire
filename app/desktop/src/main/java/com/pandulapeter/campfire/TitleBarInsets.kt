/**

 * the top that Android's status bar and iOS's are, so that every screen already keeps its content clear of the window
 * buttons while its background reaches under them. A full screen window has no title bar (on macOS, until the pointer
 * reaches the top of the screen, and then the system draws it over the content), so it gets none.
 *
 * Compose Desktop has no public way to set the insets; this is the composition local its own `WindowInsets` read.
