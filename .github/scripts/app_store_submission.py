Submits an uploaded build for App Review, which is everything a release used to need App Store Connect open for.

    app_store_submission.py <bundle identifier> <IOS | MAC_OS> <version> <build number> <release notes file> [--prepare]

It waits for App Store Connect to finish processing the build (processing is also where a build is refused, with the
reason mailed; this fails with the state instead of waiting forever), takes the platform's version for the release -
the one that already carries that version string, or else the editable one, renamed, or else a new one, set to be
released as soon as it is approved - attaches the build, writes the release notes as its "What's New" and submits it.
With --prepare it stops before the submission, leaving the version ready in App Store Connect for somebody to add the
release's screenshots to and submit it there; a later run with the same build submits it as it is.

A draft that is already there - a version prepared in App Store Connect for this release, with its new screenshots,
whether or not it has been added to a review submission, or one that was rejected - is used as it is: the build is
attached to it and its "What's New" replaced with the notes, everything else in it is kept exactly as it is, the release
option included, and it is submitted, in the review submission it is already in where there is one.

A version that is already waiting for review or further along with this very build is left as it is, so a run that is
repeated does not fail on its own success. Where another build is waiting for Apple - under review, or approved
and not on the store yet - this one is not submitted at all, since a platform takes one version at a time: it stays in
TestFlight, the run says so with a warning rather than failing, and it is submitted by hand once the other one has been
decided, or replaced by the next release's build. That is decided before waiting for processing, which a build that is
not going to be submitted has no reason to wait for.

Uses the App Store Connect API the way app_store_signing.py does, and the same environment.
