"""
Checks that every tracked source file starts with the MPL-2.0 header, for tests.yml.

The header is written in each language's own comment syntax (/* */ in Kotlin, # in Python and YAML, <!-- --> in XML
and Markdown), so what is looked for is its text rather than its exact lines: the two sentences every form carries,
within the first lines of the file. A file a tool writes and rewrites on its own (the run configurations, the Xcode
link, the baseline profiles) or one that is test data read byte for byte cannot carry one, and is allowed by name.
