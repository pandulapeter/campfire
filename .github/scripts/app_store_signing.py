Signing identities that last one workflow run, and until the next one where that run uploaded a build.

Apple's distribution certificates expire after a year, and a certificate kept in a repository secret is a release that
fails on the day it does. The App Store Connect API key does not expire, and an Admin key may create certificates and
provisioning profiles - so a run makes its own: a private key that never leaves the runner, a certificate for it,
the profiles that name that certificate. A build has to stay signed by a valid certificate until App Review has
approved it, not only until it is uploaded or processed: one whose certificate is revoked in the meantime is refused as
an invalid binary (ITMS-90238, CSSMERR_TP_CERT_REVOKED), even after it has been attached and submitted. So a run that
uploaded a build notes which build it was in the state file (`record-build`) and keeps its identities, and the workflow
hands the state file on as an artifact, which the next run of the same workflow revokes before it makes its own
(`cleanup-earlier`) - unless App Store Connect says the build is attached to a version that is still waiting for review,
in review or not on the store yet, in which case it is left alone and the artifact kept, to be asked about again by the
run after. A state file from before builds were recorded is kept for as long as any version of the platform is waiting
for Apple. A build that was uploaded and not submitted is revoked by the next run, whose own build replaces it. A run
that uploaded nothing revokes its own at the end. Revoking a distribution certificate does not touch what Apple has
already released, which it signs again. Apple tells certificates made here and certificates made by hand apart in no way the API
shows, so what a run made is known only from its state file: an artifact that expires before the next run leaves its
certificates to expire on their own after a year. Never use this for a Developer ID certificate: an app signed outside
the store is checked against it on every Mac that opens it, and revoking it breaks every copy already downloaded.

Everything this creates is written into a state file first, and `cleanup` removes exactly that and nothing else, so an
identity somebody made by hand is never touched. It only needs the Python standard library and the system's openssl.
